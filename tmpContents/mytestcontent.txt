!!!picoquic!

Minimalist implementation of the QUIC protocol, as defined by the IETF.
The IETF spec started with the version of QUIC defined by Google and
implemented in Chrome, but the IETF spec is independent of Chrome, and
does not attempt to be backward compatible. The main developer is
Christian Huitema.

The first goal of this project is to provide feedback on the development
of a QUIC standard in the IETF QUIC WG. Information on the WG is available at
https://datatracker.ietf.org/wg/quic/charter/. The in-progress version of
the spec is available on GitHub at https://github.com/quicwg.

The second goal is to experiment with API for non-HTTP development, such as
DNS over QUIC. Then there are plenty of other features we may dream off,
such as support for multipath, or support for peer-to-peer applications.
That's on the horizon, but not there now.
